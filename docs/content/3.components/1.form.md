# Usage

## Schema

The `schema` prop is the most important part of the `<AutoForm>` component.
It defines the structure and validation rules for your form using Zod.

## Initial State

Use the `initialState` prop to set default values for your form fields.
It has type `Partial<z.InferInput<T>>`{lang="ts-type"}, where `T` is your Zod schema type.

::tip
You can use it to pre-fill the form with existing data, where for example
you want to provide submit or edit form feature.
